        "Have a look and see why the UK and EU issued regulatory guidance on the PQC in summer 2025. This video is not really about quantum computing and quantum algorithms in finance, but about the impact of quantum computing on current and future cryptography. A lot of half-baked information is going around, so I decided to make a video that explains modern cryptography from scratch â€” as simple as possible, but not simpler, as usual in my videos.",

        "The Business Perspective on Quantum Technology: How to Develop Your Corporate Quantum Roadmap. Quantum is no longer just a research topic â€” itâ€™s becoming a strategic challenge for industries like finance, pharma, and energy. The real question is: how should companies prepare today for a technology that will mature over the next 10â€“15 years? The key message: itâ€™s not about counting qubits. Itâ€™s about aligning technology evolution with corporate strategy, managing risks early, and building the capability to capture future opportunities.",
